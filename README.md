# ETL Project for XML, JSON, and CSV Files with Python
  This project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that processes data from various file formats: CSV, JSON, and XML. The extracted data contains information about individuals (name, height, and weight), which is transformed by converting height from inches to meters and weight from pounds to kilograms. 
  
  The transformed data is then saved into a single CSV file for future queries, and a log file is maintained to track the progress of each phase of the ETL process.

### Prerequisites
  pandas, glob, xml.etree.ElementTree, datetime.
